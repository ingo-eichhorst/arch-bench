# 01_introduction_and_goals.adoc - Introduction and Goals of the Architecture Benchmark Tool

== Introduction and Goals

=== Requirements Overview

The Architecture Benchmark Tool is a command-line application designed to evaluate and benchmark Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) on software architecture tasks. The tool aims to provide standardized, reproducible benchmarks for assessing the quality of LLM outputs in the context of software architecture.

Key requirements include:

* Execute predefined benchmark scenarios across multiple evaluation dimensions
* Support for both text-only and vision-based architectural tasks
* Extensible benchmark scenario definition system
* Standardized result collection and reporting
* Model-agnostic design with pluggable model interfaces
* Support for parallel execution of tests
* Ability to resume interrupted benchmark runs

=== Quality Goals

[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Priority |Quality Goal |Motivation
|1 |Maintainability |The system must be easy to maintain and extend with new benchmarks and metrics. This is achieved through a hexagonal architecture that clearly separates core logic from external dependencies.
|2 |Extensibility |The system should be easily extendable with new benchmark scenarios, scoring mechanisms, and LLM providers without requiring code changes to the core system.
|3 |Reliability |The system must handle API failures gracefully, persist results to prevent data loss, and validate benchmark definitions and configurations.
|4 |Performance |The system should efficiently handle large architectural diagrams and optimize model API usage through parallel execution where possible.
