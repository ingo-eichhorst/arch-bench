=== Quality Scenarios

==== Maintainability Scenarios

.Scenario M-1: Code Modification
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Maintainability
|Scenario |A developer needs to modify the behavior of a metric calculation
|Trigger |New requirement for metric calculation
|Response |Developer can locate and modify the relevant code without affecting other parts
|Response Measure |Changes confined to metric service, no changes needed in other components
|===

.Scenario M-2: Documentation Update
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Maintainability
|Scenario |Documentation needs to be updated for a new feature
|Trigger |New feature implementation
|Response |Developer can easily update relevant documentation
|Response Measure |Documentation can be updated within 1 hour
|===

==== Extensibility Scenarios

.Scenario E-1: New LLM Provider
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Extensibility
|Scenario |Integration of a new LLM provider
|Trigger |New LLM provider becomes available
|Response |Developer can add new provider through adapter pattern
|Response Measure |Integration completed within 1 day
|===

.Scenario E-2: New Metric
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Extensibility
|Scenario |Addition of a new evaluation metric
|Trigger |New evaluation requirement
|Response |Developer can add new metric through metric service
|Response Measure |New metric added and tested within 4 hours
|===

==== Reliability Scenarios

.Scenario R-1: API Failure
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Reliability
|Scenario |LLM API becomes temporarily unavailable
|Trigger |Network or service failure
|Response |System retries with backoff, persists state
|Response Measure |No data loss, automatic recovery when API available
|===

.Scenario R-2: Invalid Configuration
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Reliability
|Scenario |User provides invalid benchmark configuration
|Trigger |Loading invalid configuration file
|Response |System validates and provides clear error message
|Response Measure |Error detected before benchmark starts, clear message provided
|===

==== Performance Scenarios

.Scenario P-1: Large Scale Benchmark
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Performance
|Scenario |Running benchmark with 100 test cases
|Trigger |Benchmark execution command
|Response |System executes tests in parallel where possible
|Response Measure |Completion time scales linearly with API rate limits
|===

.Scenario P-2: Resource Usage
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Performance
|Scenario |System running multiple benchmarks simultaneously
|Trigger |Multiple benchmark executions
|Response |System manages resources efficiently
|Response Measure |Memory usage remains stable, no resource leaks
|===
