a| 
*Value Proposition* +

The Architecture Benchmark Tool enables users to create domain-specific benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing initially on software architecture tasks.

.2+a| *Core Functions* +

- Execute predefined benchmark scenarios
- Support for text-only and vision-based tasks
- Extensible benchmark scenario definition
- Standardized result collection and reporting

.3+a| *Core Decisions - Good or Bad* +

Good:
- Hexagonal architecture for maintainability
- Plugin system for extensibility

Bad:
- Initial learning curve with Go

Strategic:
- Adoption of Go for learning purposes

.3+a| *Technologies* +

- Go programming language
- OpenAI API
- Local file storage

.2+a| *Key Stakeholder* +

- Software Architects
- LLM Researchers
- Open Source Contributors

a| *Quality Requirements* +

- Maintainability
- Extensibility
- Reliability
- Performance

2+a| *Business Context* +

- Integration with LLM APIs
- Open source development model

2+a| *Components / Modules* +

- CLI Adapter
- Config Adapter
- LLM Adapter
- Core Domain
- Services

2+a| *Core Risks* +

- Dependency on LLM APIs
- Learning curve for Go

2+a| *Missing Information* +

- Future scalability requirements
- Potential new LLM providers
