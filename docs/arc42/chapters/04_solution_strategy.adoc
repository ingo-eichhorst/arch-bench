title Hexagonal Architecture Overview

System_Boundary(c1, "Architecture Benchmark Tool") {
    Container(cli, "CLI Adapter", "Primary Port", "Handles user interaction")
    
    Container(core, "Core Domain", "Hexagon", "Contains business logic")

==== Core Domain Design

The core domain is designed around these key concepts:

* Benchmark
** Contains multiple test suites
** Defines overall configuration
** Manages execution flow

* TestSuite
** Groups related test cases
** Defines evaluation metrics
** Provides suite-level configuration

* TestCase
** Contains input and expected output
** Defines test-specific parameters
** Stores execution results

* Metric
** Evaluates LLM responses
** Calculates scores
** Provides detailed feedback

==== Technical Approaches

===== Parallel Execution

[plantuml]
....
@startuml
!include <C4/C4_Container>

title Parallel Execution Strategy

rectangle "Benchmark Controller" as controller
rectangle "Test Suite 1" as suite1
rectangle "Test Suite 2" as suite2

rectangle "Test Case 1.1" as case11
rectangle "Test Case 1.2" as case12
rectangle "Test Case 2.1" as case21
rectangle "Test Case 2.2" as case22

controller --> suite1
controller --> suite2

suite1 --> case11
suite1 --> case12
suite2 --> case21
suite2 --> case22

note right of controller
  Orchestrates parallel execution
  within rate limits
end note

note right of suite1
  Independent test suites
  run in parallel
end note

note right of case11
  Test cases run in parallel
  when possible
end note

** Input validation
** Result validation

=== Development Approach

==== Test-Driven Development

* Unit Tests
** Core domain logic
